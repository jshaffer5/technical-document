      <p>PHP is a general use programming language that has been an integral part of web development since around the time of its creation in 1994.</p>

<p>The Standard PHP Library (SPL) is a collection of interfaces and classes that are meant to solve common problems. Here are some of the ways it can be useful: </p>

<li>Performing various operations on strings such as finding the length, substituting, and searching for substrings</li>
<li>Working with Date and Time objects and formatting them</li>

          <p>Let's get a basic feel for PHP's syntax and standard library with some code:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>function say_hello( $name, $date ) {
              echo "Hello, " . $name . "\n";
              echo "Today is " . $date;
            }
            
            $date = date("D M d, Y G:i");
            say_hello( 'World', $date );
            </code>
            </pre>

          <p>Result: </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              Hello, World
              Today is Fri May 10, 2019 4:00
            </code>
          </pre>
            
      </artice>

          Basic Syntax
        </header>
        
        <article>
          <p> PHP's syntax draws heavily from the C programming language and as such bears a strong resemblance to the syntax of other modern programming languages. </p>
          <p> Declaring a variable for example follows a familiar pattern if you have some experience with other languages: </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              $foo = 2;
              $bar = 2;
              $baz = $foo + $bar;
              echo "The variable \$baz = " . $baz;
            </code>
          </pre>

          <p>Result: </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              The variable $baz = 4
            </code>
          </pre>

          <p> Okay, you might be a little frustrated by these <i>echo</i> statements from the last two examples so here's a quick explanation: 
            The <i>echo</i> is actually what is known as a language construct and we can pass parameters (i.e. $bar) to it and it will output them for us. 
            The reason for the period ('.') between the two parameters is that we are concatenating, or combining, them into one argument which is passed to <i>echo</i>. 
            We also use the backslash ('\') on <i>$bar</i> in the first parameter to tell php we want to output a literal ('$') symbol rather than retrieve the value of <i>$bar</i> inside our string. 
            If we actual wanted to place <i>$bar</i>'s value inside the string that would be known as <i>string interpolation</i>.
          </p>
          
          <p>And if that explanation made no sense to you please don't get too discouraged, this stuff takes a long time to get familiar with! </p>

          Data Types
        </header>
        
        <article>
          <p>PHP supports the following data types:</p>
          <li>String</li> 
          <li>Boolean</li>
          <li>Integer</li>
          <li>Float</li>
          <li>Array</li>
          <li>Object</li>          <li>Null</li>

          <p>       If you're new to programming some of these data types like Arrays and objects may be unfamiliar to you. 
            However you already know what ones like string, integer, and float are, at least in a basic sense. A string data type 
            is basically just a collection of text (i.e. "Hello World"). Integer and float data types just hold whole numbers, and 
            decimal numbers respectively. We'll go over some of the other data types in later sections.
          </p>

          <p>Let's go over an example where we use the string, boolean, and float data types together: </p>

          <pre>
            <code>
              // Okay so for this example let's pretend we're making a program to generate a receipt for an ice cream purchase (it's summer here right now)

              
              $foo = 2;
              $bar = 2;
              $baz = $foo + $bar;
              echo "The variable \$baz = " . $baz;
            </code>
          </pre>

          <p>Result: </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              The variable $baz = 4
            </code>
          </pre>

          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
          <pre>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) {
              alert("Hello " + yourName);
            }
            greetMe("World");</code>
          </pre>

            <code>function greetMe(yourName) {
              alert("Hello " + yourName);
            }
            greetMe("World");</code>
          </pre>
          
          <pre>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) {
              alert("Hello " + yourName);
            }
            greetMe("World");</code>
