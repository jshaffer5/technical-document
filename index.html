            This document is meant to serve as a practical guide for learning useful concepts for building server side web applications with PHP. 
            Although I've done my best to make the guide as easy to follow as possible, you may become frustrated trying to get set up and 
            understand some of the concepts if you are not familiar enough with HTML, JavaScript, and using the command line and text editors.  
            Of course there is no shortage of good documentation and tutorials for learning PHP, but the purpose of this guide is to provide a 
            quick, easy to digest resource for setting up a local server running PHP, and learning some of the most useful concepts such as key 
            language features and using javascript with PHP to process html forms and create dynamic web pages.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you're eager to get to the code feel free to jump ahead to the next <a href="#Key_Features">section</a>, but it can be useful to get 
            a little context on the origins of the language and why it's useful.
          </p>
          <p>
            PHP is a powerful server side scripting language designed to allow you to write dynamically generated web pages. In practice, one of 
            the most useful features of php is the simplicity of using its api to connect to a MYSQL database. By combing this functionality with 
            javascript's XMLHttpRequest(), known commonly as <abbr title="Asynchronous Javascript and XML">AJAX</abbr>, to make calls to your server 
            side php script, dynamic web pages can be created with relative ease.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you're wondering what the letters in PHP stand for, well according to the preface of the official php 
            <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/preface.php">manual</a>, the acronym stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor". Now, if you're like me 
            and you're wondering what the hell is the point of a so called "recursive acronym" that refers to itself in the definition, then you may 
            be more content to know that when the language was originally written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf">Rasmus 
            Lerdorf</a> in 1994, its acronym stood for "Personal Home Page." As more programmers became involved in developing the language, its
            acronym was changed, perhaps to reflect its broader scope.
          </p>

          <p>
            You may be wondering what is the value of learning PHP at a time when much of the web development industry is focusing on languages 
            such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby and others for server side programming. Well, PHP is still the most widely used server side language 
            in the world, and this is reflected in the amount of documentation, tutorials, and frameworks available. In addition, learning web 
            development is not an easy feat. There is a vast amount of technologies and concepts used in web development, and it's often difficult 
            to understand why such technologies exist or how they should be used without having some historical context of how the internet has 
            changed since the early days of the World Wide Web. By using PHP to learn some of the 
            basic server side concepts such as handling HTTP requests, connecting to a database, and routing, it becomes easier to understand how 
            to apply these concepts in newer frameworks and technologies.

          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
          <pre>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) {
              alert("Hello " + yourName);
